# Tronxy-XY-2-Pro

Modifications to Tronxy XY-2 Pro

- GCODE config is for original CHITU firmware (and obsolete now)

- SCAD model for a Ribbon cable clip to hold cable against 40x40 profile

- SCAD model for a 3D/BL Touch mount as a repacment for the inductive sensor.

My Tronxy XY-2 Pro has been updated to latest Marlin and 3D Touch sensor.
